To resolve the issue, you need to configure Tailwind's purge settings to correctly identify dynamically generated content. This can involve using a more comprehensive purge option or configuring the framework's Tailwind integration to handle dynamic classes.

**Solution using `@apply` directive (Recommended):**

Instead of directly using utility classes in your dynamic content, utilize Tailwind's `@apply` directive within your component styles. This ensures that Tailwind always includes the styles, regardless of how or when the content is generated.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
<div className="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Dynamic Content</h2>
  <div className="@apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-2">This content has dynamic styling.</div>
</div>
```

**Solution using Purge Options (Less Recommended):**

You can adjust the `purge` option in your `tailwind.config.js` to include more content sources, such as specific directories or file patterns. However, this approach can be less precise and might result in larger CSS files.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: {
    content: ['./pages/**/*.js', './components/**/*.js', './src/**/*.js'],
    options: {
      safelist: ['bg-blue-500', 'text-white'] // Add dynamic classes to the safelist
    }
  },
  // ...rest of your config
};
```
